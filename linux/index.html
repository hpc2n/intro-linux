<p>This section will give an overview of some of the most common terminology of Linux, as it may not be familiar to someone coming from i.e. Windows. It is, however, useful to know the meaning of some of the terms you will often see when searching for information about Linux or anything done on a Linux system. </p>
<p>For a more detailed list of Linux terminology, there is a link to a <a href="https://www.miralishahidi.ir/resources/Linux%20Terminology%20Glossary.pdf" target="_blanket">Glossary of Linux Terms</a>. </p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#linux" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While we usually think of Linux as an operating system, that is not strictly true; Linux is a free and open-source <strong>kernel</strong> developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.</p>
<h2 id="kernel">Kernel<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>‘Kernels’ are at the core of every Operating System (OS). </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A kernel manages your system&rsquo;s hardware, as well as all the programs on your computer. </p>
<p>When, for instance, you press a key on your keyboard or use your mouse to click a button on the screen, this information gets sent through the kernel. It will then communicate with the operating system, to use the data as input and to show the output using the hardware (in this case the monitor). </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Linux</strong>: the base Linux kernel is open-source. A large number of distributions (distros) use this core. They then modify it to lesser or greater extent, suiting their particular goals.</p>
<p>The Linux kernel: 
- is the core component of the Linux OS
- is open source and actively developed by a large community
- manages hardware resources
- handles communication between software and hardware
- is in charge of 
    - device drivers
    - process management
    - memory management
    - other low-level system operations </p>
<h2 id="distributions__distros">Distributions (distros)<a class="headerlink" href="#distributions__distros" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Different versions of Linux are called distributions or &ldquo;distros&rdquo;. </p>
</div>
<p>There are a large number of Linux distributions, as anyone can create their own Linux distro. It is thus important to check at least the most popular distros if you are considering to switch to another operating system. Some are easier to use than others. </p>
<p>Examples of popular Linux distros are: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Slackware, Gentoo, Arch, Mint, and many others. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Many distros can be downloaded and put on a bootable USB, so you can try them out before deciding.</p>
</div>
<p>Any operating system that uses the Linux kernel is called a Linux distribution (&ldquo;distro&rdquo;). The reason for that name comes from <u>sharing</u>, or <u>distributing</u>  the Linux OS (usually for free).</p>
<p>Aside from distributions, developers make customized versions of the various &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; Linux distributions. These are called <u>remixes</u>, flavours, and <u>spins</u>. Often the differences are choices of packages, desktop environments, etc. There is no hard difference between calling the customized versions remixes, flavours, or spins - it is mainly a choice. </p>
<p>A distro is a complete operating system, including 
- the Linux kernel
- software packages
- various tools and utilities</p>
<p>The different spins/flavours of that distro could have 
- different package managers
- desktop environments
- various other features.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example: Ubuntu</p>
<p>The <u>distro</u> Ubuntu has several <strong>flavors</strong>: Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, etc. each which  has a different desktop environment. </p>
</div>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example: &ldquo;Fedora</p>
<p>The <u>distro</u> Fedora uses the expression <strong>spins</strong> for its derivatives. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="desktop__environments">Desktop environments<a class="headerlink" href="#desktop__environments" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To make it easier for users to work on their computer, many operating systems have a desktop that offers a graphical interface manage the system. Windows and macOS are common examples. Linux also has (optional) desktop(s), but things are done a little different. </p>
<p>Linux offers a great many desktops, which are called &ldquo;desktop environments&rdquo;. The vast majority of those are available to install for free. </p>
<p>Desktop environments (usually) come with a program called a &ldquo;window manager&rdquo;, as well as apps and widgets that, combined with the window manager, makes for a better user interface that can be further customized. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Popular desktop environments are GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, Pantheon, LXDE, and many more.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="window__managers">Window managers<a class="headerlink" href="#window__managers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Window managers:<br />
- are programs controlling placement and movement of windows on your screen
- usually work together with desktop environments
- can also be used separately on your Linux machine
- are lightweight and can offer better performance than desktop environments
    - do not ship with unnecessary apps and widget (you even have to install menu and compositor if you go with just a window manager)
- can be complicated to set up for non-technical users, since you need to install everything extra yourself</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the popular window managers are: i3wm, bspwm, awesome, Fluxbox</li>
<li>KDE Plasma and GNOME desktops use the KWin and Mutter window managers &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME)&rdquo; is a desktop environment used by several Linux distros. It is quite similar to the Windows desktop and can be a good choice if you are changing from that OS</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="commands">Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#commands" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The prompts that you type on the terminal are called &ldquo;commands&rdquo;. The terminal is also commonly called the &ldquo;command line&rdquo; or the &ldquo;command line interface&rdquo; (CLI).</p>
<p>There are several applications that can be used to access the command line, so it will vary how it looks, but it is usually a simple window (commonly white or green on black background or black on white background). </p>
<p><img alt="Terminal" src="../images/terminal.png" style="width: 380px; float: left; padding: 3px;" /></p>
<p>Using commands on a command line interface is something many people find to be the most intimidating thing about Linux. </p>
<p>However, while the command line is an integral part of using Linux, and some actions may be faster or more direct when done on the command line, most things can actually be done through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
<br><br style="clear: both;"></p>
<h2 id="command__line__interface__cli__terminal">Command line interface (CLI), terminal<a class="headerlink" href="#command__line__interface__cli__terminal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The terminal, console, or &ldquo;command line interface&rdquo; (often abbreviated &ldquo;CLI&rdquo;) is a text.based interface which is often the primary way to interact with Linux. </p>
<p>The terminal is where you enter your <a href="#commands">&ldquo;commands&rdquo;</a>. It is usually very straightforward and simple, but you can also choose to use a terminal emulator which will give you a more user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>It is a program that is used to control your operating system&rsquo;s <a href="#shells">&ldquo;shell&rdquo;</a>. Briefly; a shell is a text-based (or graphical interface) through which the user interact with the desktop. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Linux terminal is similar to &ldquo;Command Prompt&rdquo; on Windows. It is used by the &ldquo;super user&rdquo; or &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; to control and manage the system efficiently.</p>
<p>It can be used to configure settings, for scripting, directly controlling the system, as well as giving various other commands to any program on the system. </p>
</div>
<p>While other operating systems like Windows once regularly used something like a terminal, it is now more seldom used except for some administrative management. On Linux, however, the terminal is still very much used. This may surprise some, but there are several good reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>The command line is fast: The CLI is usually much faster than using a GUI, and command-line programs will also start faster that graphical programs due to less overhead. </li>
<li>Many programming tools use the command line: compilers, interpreters, debuggers all run on the command line. Yes, there are often a graphical IDE you can install, but that is just a wrapper for the command line program. </li>
<li>The command line works everywhere: it is easy to use remotely through SSH, for installing and maintaining servers, you can use it without starting a graphical interface, which gives less overhead and makes it faster and more efficient</li>
<li>You can script command line programs: this is a big advantage; you can avoid many repetitive operations when using a script<ul>
<li>Example: renaming, copying, or moving many files through a graphical file manager can be a hassle. On the command line you can script it. For instance, copying all your .dat files to a directory could be done like this: <code>cp *.dat /mydir</code></li>
<li>You can also use scripting for more complicated tasks. </li>
<li>Some of the most commonly used scripting languages are the shell, perl, and Python.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="root__user">Root, user<a class="headerlink" href="#root__user" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All Linux operating systems have a built-in system of user roles, where each user has a specific role, with varying levels of permissions. </p>
<p>Some of the common roles are:
- user: nothing more, nothing less. The user can normally do what they want in their own home directory and perhaps a few other directories where they have been given permission to work. A user cannot install anything to the system outside of these directories where they have permission, and also cannot change most setup files (other than those affecting only themself).
- root: The root user or root account has administrative priviliges; complete access to all configurations, commands, and files in the system. Other words for root is <strong>superuser</strong> or <strong>administrator</strong>, though <strong>root</strong> is the most common term on Linux. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>root refers to both <strong>the root directory</strong> and <strong>the root user</strong>. </p>
<p>The root directory is the top level/parent directory containing all files and folders of the system. It is designated with a &ldquo;/&rdquo;, and this is how you can denote it in your commands. </p>
</div>
<h2 id="package__manager">Package manager<a class="headerlink" href="#package__manager" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>On Linux, the programs you install are often referred to as &ldquo;packages&rdquo;. Commonly, they are installed on the command line. A &ldquo;package manager&rdquo; is a tool that gives you a graphical interface to help you find new packages, install, update, and sometimes even configure them.</p>
<p>On Linux, most <strong>apps</strong> are distributed as packages and are available in the official repositories of your distribution. You can also add third-party repositories with a package manager if you want access to even more packages. </p>
<p>There are several different package managers available for the different Linux distros. These are some of the popular ones:
- APT: used by Debian and Ubuntu-based distributions. 
- RPM: used by Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.
- pacman: used by Arch Linux and its derivatives. 
- yum/dnf: used by Red Hat-based distributions. </p>
<h2 id="source__and__binary__packages">Source and binary packages<a class="headerlink" href="#source__and__binary__packages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Source packages: these contain the source code of a program: A user must manually compile and install it to run the software. </li>
<li>Binary packages: these contain prebuilt and pre-compiled executables for the software.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#repositories" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Collections of packages and their metadata can be found in <strong>software repositories</strong> on remote servers. Most Linux distros has their own set of repositories or else they use the repositories of their parent distro. </p>
<h2 id="open__source">Open Source<a class="headerlink" href="#open__source" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Wikipedia defines Open Source as: </p>
<p>Source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source code, design documents, or content of the product. The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. </p>
<p>Open source has played a significant role in the growth and popularity of Linux.</p>
