## chown - change ownership

To change ownership of a file or directory, use the command <code>chown</code>. 

<div>
```bash
chown [OPTIONS] USER[:GROUP] FILE(s)
```
</div>

!!! Note "Examples"

    - <code>chown USERNAME FILE</code> the user with USERNAME becomes the new owner of FILE
    - <code>chown USERNAME DIRECTORY</code> the user with USERNAME becomes the new owner of DIRECTORY (but not any subdirectories)
    - <code>chown USERNAME:folk DIRECTORY</code> the user ownership is changed to USER and the group ownership to group "folk" for the directory DIRECTORY
    - <code>chown :folk DIRECTORY</code> the group ownership is changed to the group "folk" for the directory DIRECTORY
    - <code>chown -R USERNAME:folk DIRECTORY</code> the user ownership is changed to USERNAME and the group ownership is changed to group "folk" for the directory DIRECTORY and all subdirectories

    As default, <code>chown</code> does not generate output on success and returns zero.
